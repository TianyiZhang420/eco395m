Hello everyone! My name is Tianyi Zhang, but you can also call me Serena. I'm from Jiangsu, China, and I completed my undergraduate studies in Information Management and Information Systems. This is my first year in Austin, where I am majoring in Information Studies. I have a keen interest in UX/UI track and Data Science.
In my spare time, I enjoy going to live music venues and listening to various styles of music. I also like playing ball games, such as squash and racquetball. I'm excited to be a part of this class and to learn these valuable data tools with all of you.
